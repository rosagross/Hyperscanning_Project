## Hyperscanning_Project

This repository contains the code for the NBP hyperscanning project a the University of Osnabr√ºck 2020/21.
It is a further developed version from the code uploaded on [this repository](https://github.com/DiGyt/NBP_Hyperscanning). We modified the packages that were used for the audio and visual stimulus rendering due to latencies when (dis)playing stimuli.
