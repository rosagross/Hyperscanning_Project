## Hyperscanning_Project

This repository contains the code for the NBP hyperscanning project a the University of Osnabrück 2020/21.
It is a further developed version from the code uploaded on [this repository](https://github.com/DiGyt/NBP_Hyperscanning). We modified the packages that were used for the audio and visual stimulus rendering due to latencies when (dis)playing stimuli.

To use this code it's recommended to have at least python 3.5 installed.
